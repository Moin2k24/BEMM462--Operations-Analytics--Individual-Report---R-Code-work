# BEMM462--Operations-Analytics--Individual-Report---R-Code-work
This repository contains R scripts developed for the BEMM462 Operations Analytics Individual Report. The codebase addresses three key areas of operations analytics:
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA): Evaluates project efficiency using the Benchmarking package by comparing inputs (e.g., person-days, CPU time) to output (profit).
Linear Programming (LP): Models optimal resource allocation across multiple factories under supply and capacity constraints using the lpSolve package.
Network Optimization: Applies shortest and longest path algorithms using igraph to determine the most cost-efficient or profit-maximizing project and influencer network routes.
Each Script is modular and annotated for clarity and reproducibility. The solutions aid decision-making by quantifying trade-offs in performance, logistics, and connectivity.
